# Changelog

## v0.1.1 (2026-02-16)

### Features
- **Real type inference** — field access on typed records now resolves types; `user.email + 42` correctly produces type errors. Pattern bindings extract inner types from Result/enum variants.
- **Schema derivation** — nested user types generate fully resolved JSON Schema. Enum variants produce `oneOf` schemas. `Map[K,V]` generates `additionalProperties`.
- **Capability enforcement** — all 6 effect subsystems (HTTP, store, memory, LLM, tool, topic) now check capabilities at runtime.
- **Production LLM backend** — Anthropic integration with `llm.chat`, `llm.json`, `llm.stream`. Token-level usage tracking. Anti-corruption layer for provider-agnostic response format.
- **Enriched traces** — every effect call produces structured trace spans with timing, outcome, and token usage.
- **Persistent EventStore** — SQLite backend for events (opt-in, ETS remains default).
- **Replay engine** — recorded response injection for deterministic golden tests.
- **Agent memory isolation** — instance-scoped memory prevents concurrent agents from overwriting each other.
- **Tool input validation** — tool calls validated against declared schemas.
- **Error context enrichment** — structured error contexts with source locations.
- **Source text wiring** — `compile_file`/`compile_string` thread source text through for better error reporting.
- **Linux ARM64 builds** — `aarch64` added to distribution targets.

### Fixes
- Float division codegen generates correct Core Erlang
- Contextual keywords (`input`, `from`, `trace`) no longer reserved — usable as variable names
- Multiple `emit` in a single handler now collects all events (previously only the last was kept)
- Capability params codegen handles `ToolRef` and `Identifier` nodes
- Compiler test suite cross-app dependency resolved (181 failures fixed)

### Docs & Spec
- Spec sections 8.2–8.5 rewritten to use implemented syntax
- Landing page, quickstart, and overview rewritten for binary distribution
- Prebuilt binary install instructions added to README
- Comprehensive coverage for Tier 2 features in docs and tests

### Examples
- `market_research_agent.skein` — 5-phase competitive analysis agent with gather↔analyze loop
- `skein_assistant.skein` — stateful conversational agent for Skein code help

### Test Suite
- **1,316 tests + 182 property-based tests**, 0 failures (up from 1,176 + 182 in v0.1.0)

## v0.1.0

Initial release. Full compilation pipeline, 12 language constructs, stdlib, CLI, LSP, docs site.

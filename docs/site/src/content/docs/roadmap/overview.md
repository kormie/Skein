title: Roadmap
description: Current project status, what's been built, and prioritized next steps.
---

Skein's compilation pipeline, runtime, standard library, editor tooling, and distribution packaging are all functional. This page covers the current state, forward-looking priorities, and a history of completed work. The canonical, more detailed version lives in [`docs/ROADMAP.md`](https://github.com/kormie/Skein/blob/main/docs/ROADMAP.md).

## Current State

The end-to-end pipeline works: `.skein` source files lex, parse, analyze, generate Core Erlang, compile to BEAM bytecode, and execute on OTP. The runtime supports agents, HTTP handlers, queue/schedule/topic handlers, storage (ETS and Ecto/SQLite), LLM integration (production Anthropic backend with streaming, AWS Bedrock, and an OpenAI-compatible backend for local models), tool calling, memory, tracing, replayable event sourcing, and guard expressions in match arms.

The full test suite (unit, property-based, and integration) runs green in CI on every change — see the CI badge on the README for current totals; counts aren't tracked here because they grow with every change.

**Sixteen example programs** (thirteen single-file plus the multi-file `market_research` project and its single-file variant) compile and run warning-free, covering HTTP APIs, agents with LLM and tools, queue workers, pub/sub notifications, background tasks, audit logging, semantic search, and a conversational assistant. All are covered by integration tests.

## Release Status

The release train so far: **v0.2.0** and **v0.3.0** shipped 2026-06-11, and **v1.0.0-rc.1** was tagged 2026-06-12. **A 2026-06-15 roadmap reset re-sequenced the path to 1.0.** A source-verified dogfooding audit of the skein-testing and FablePool ports reclassified GA from a docs-accuracy cleanup into a soundness + honesty + observability + conformance gate. **v1.0.0 GA is not imminent, and the next release is a development release (v0.4.0), not another RC.** The earlier "the rc soaks, then promotes to 1.0" plan is superseded.

---

## What's Next

The path to 1.0 is six waves across two development milestones, then a true RC, then GA. The canonical detail (waves, acceptance criteria, citations) lives in [`docs/ROADMAP.md`](https://github.com/kormie/Skein/blob/main/docs/ROADMAP.md).

### v0.4.0 — Soundness & scenario capability environments

Waves 0–2: stop RC-promotion framing and make the docs/spec truthful; finish type/runtime soundness and pin it with a negative-fixture corpus; and ship **scenario-scoped capability environments** — a scenario declares the complete capability environment a tool may exercise, as a nested `capability tool.use(T) { capability http.out(...) { implement(...) } }` tree with local, typed, pure `implement` blocks. This **replaces** the earlier `via &stub` design (now superseded and out of 1.0).

### v0.5.0 — Observability, canonical substrate & conformance

Waves 3–6: a deterministic scenario/golden/replay gate (tests never accidentally hit live effects); CLI human/agent observability (framework-neutral trace renderer, byte-stable plain output, JSON schemas, a TTY/TUI gate that never breaks MCP/LSP/non-TTY protocols); a minimal canonical bytes/hash substrate (only if "FablePool-capable" stays in the pitch); and a dogfood conformance gate that compiles, loads, and **runs** reduced programs from Skein, skein-testing, and FablePool-skein.

### Post-1.0 Backlog

Tracked in [`docs/ROADMAP.md`](https://github.com/kormie/Skein/blob/main/docs/ROADMAP.md) with linked issues:

- **v1.1: Hardening & Language** — closures (#248), effectful crypto (#257), content-addressed store (#255), language ergonomics (#251/#249/#247), `via` if still useful, `llm.rerank` (#145), docs/spec drift guards (#202), LSP rename/references (#240)
- **v1.2: Interop & Agent Workflows** — Erlang/Elixir FFI (`extern`, #141), human-in-the-loop approval workflows (#144), web trace viewer (#143), Raxol CLI TUI (#171, separately gated), structural codemod (#241)

## Completed Work

Everything below is implemented and tested.

### Core Pipeline (Phases 1–7)

| Phase | Name | Summary |
|-------|------|---------|
| 1 | Hello BEAM | End-to-end compilation: lexer → parser → analyzer → Core Erlang → BEAM |
| 2 | Type System | Type checking, schemas, constraint annotations, `Option[T]`, `Result[T, E]`, `!`/`?` operators |
| 3 | Capabilities & Effects | Capability declarations, compile-time checking (modules + agents), HTTP client, tracing |
| 4 | Handlers & HTTP | HTTP handlers with routing, request dispatch, Bandit + Plug server |
| 5 | Storage | ETS-backed `store.table` with get, get!, put, put!, delete, query |
| 6 | Agents | Agent state machines, phases, transitions, memory, LLM, tools, events |
| 7 | Testing & CLI | Test constructs, full CLI (new, build, test, run, trace) |

### Infrastructure (Phase 8)

| Sub-phase | Name | Summary |
|-----------|------|---------|
| 8a | Test Infrastructure | Scenario tests (`given`/`expect`), golden trace tests, replay engine (trace loading + memory rebuild) |
| 8b | Storage Backend | Ecto schema generation, migrations, SQLite via `ecto_sqlite3`, persistent EventStore |
| 8c | HTTP Server | Bandit + Plug integration, `req.json[T]` body validation |
| 8d | Canonical Examples | 14 working programs with integration tests |
| 8e | Queue & Schedule | `handler queue` and `handler schedule` constructs |
| 8f | LLM Streaming | `llm.stream` with chunked responses and trace spans |

### Type System & Schemas

- Field access resolves through user-defined type declarations; `user.email + 42` is a type error (E0020)
- Pattern bindings carry the inner types of `Result`, `Option`, and enum variants
- Nested user types generate fully resolved JSON Schema; enum variants produce `oneOf`; `Map[K, V]` generates `additionalProperties`; circular references are safe

### LLM Integration

- Production **Anthropic backend** (Messages API): `chat`, `json` (schema-in-system-prompt), `stream` (SSE), retry on 429, structured errors, API-key redaction
- Model-scoped runtime capability checks: `llm.chat("model-x", ...)` without a matching `capability model(...)` is blocked
- Current model IDs throughout examples and docs

### Hardening

| Item | Summary |
|------|---------|
| Float division codegen | `/` uses Erlang `/` for floats, `div` for integers |
| String-literal match patterns | `match s { "approve" -> ... }` compiles to proper binary patterns |
| `state.field` everywhere | Agent state access works in nested expression positions |
| `method!(args)` parsing | `store.users.get!(id)` parses as unwrap-of-call (likewise `?`) |
| Contextual keywords | `input`, `output`, `state`, etc. no longer globally reserved |
| Multiple `emit` per handler | All events accumulated, not just the last |
| Agent instance-scoped memory | Keys scoped as `{agent}:{instance}:{key}`; concurrent instances don't collide |
| Tool input validation | Inputs validated against the tool's JSON Schema; `validation_error` on mismatch |
| Capability naming | `queue.consume` / `schedule.trigger` (old names get a targeted rename hint) |
| Cross-module `tool.call` | `implement` blocks compile to callable entry points; tools registered at module load (v0.1.5) |
| Variant construction | `Ok(x)`, `Err(e)`, `Event.Charge(n)`, `ErrName.from(cause)`, and zero-field forms (`Status.Active`, bare `Active`) all compile in expression position; unknown variants and wrong arity are structured errors |
| Spec section 8 sweep | Every section-8 example compiles with zero diagnostics (pinned by `spec_examples_test.exs`) |
| zsh tab-completion | `skein completions zsh` (drift-tested against the help text) |
| MCP compile_check fidelity | Warnings included (`Compiler.check_file/1`); project mode checks `src/` + `test/` like `skein test` |
| Structured assertion failures | Failing asserts report operands, rendered expression, and `file:line` (Skein.Runtime.AssertionError) |
| `skein new` git init | Repo + baseline `.gitignore` scaffolded by default (`--no-git` to skip; never nests inside an existing work tree) |
| Agent events to EventStore | `emit` flushes durably as `:user_event` (agent/instance/phase tags); crash-safe |
| Schedule auto-firing | Cron tick with per-minute dedup; Server registers schedule handlers; `tick_at/1` for deterministic tests |
| Capability checks in test blocks | Effects inside `test`/`scenario`/`golden` require capabilities (E0012) and count as usage (no scaffold W0002) |
| Named arguments in calls | `f(name: value)` for local fns and documented effect signatures; analyzer rewrites to positional order at compile time (E0026 on misuse) |
| Agent nesting inside modules | `module Foo { agent Bar }` → `Skein.Agent.Foo.Bar`; module types and capabilities apply to the nested agent |
| Types usable from agents | Module types visible to nested agents; derived JSON Schema flows into `llm.json[T]` from agent handlers |
| Persistent EventStore | SQLite-backed event store (opt-in, ETS default) |
| Error system | Structured error/warning codes (spec §7); `context` and `fix_code` populated on all analyzer/parser/lexer errors |
| Replay backend injection | Recorded traces intercept `llm`/`http`/`tool` effects on replay; exhausted or mismatched traces are structured errors, never silent live calls (#73) |
| Scoped capability labels | `memory.kv`/`event.log`/`process.spawn`/`timer` capability params are scope labels the compiler threads into runtime calls and the runtime enforces exactly (#69, #57) |
| Task bodies | `process.spawn("name", &fn)` and `timer.after`/`timer.interval` work arguments run in supervised tasks (#74, #155) |
| Local LLM backends | OpenAI-compatible backend + `[env.<name>.llm]` profiles in `skein.toml` with `model_map` for Ollama/LM Studio/vLLM dev loops (#107) |
| AWS Bedrock backend | Converse API with SigV4 signing, `region` + `model_map` config (#173) |
| Match guards | `pattern if expr ->` with a guard-safe operator subset (#147) |
| Value-level exhaustiveness | W0004 warns when a variant is covered only by literal field patterns (#76) |
| LSP code actions | Editor quickfixes built from each diagnostic's `fix_hint`/`fix_code` (#108) |
| `llm.embed` backend | Embeddings served by the OpenAI-compatible backend's `/embeddings` endpoint (#146) |
